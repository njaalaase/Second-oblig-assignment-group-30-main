					The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is
					a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by
					nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this internal
					energy is emitted from its surface as light, ultraviolet,
					and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for
					life on Earth.

				The Sun moves around the Galactic Center of the Milky Way, at a
				distance of 26,660 light-years. From Earth it is on average 1 AU
				(1.496×108 km) or about 8 light-minutes far away. Its diameter
				is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi; 4.64 ls), 109 times that of
				Earth or 4 lunar distances. Its mass is about 330,000 times that
				of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar
				System.[18] Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of
				hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much
				smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen,
				carbon, neon, and iron.
